I'm Shium Mashud! 

I'm currently a high school senior primarily interested in full-stack application development and data science. 🏫

I'm interested in developing scalable and reliable software infrastructure through TDD and deliberate software architecture planning. I'm also passionate about my research interests in health informatics and working with high-dimensional data sets. 🤓

I'm currently learning and working with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Feel free to look around!
